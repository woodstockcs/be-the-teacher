In this assignment you will think about how to explain Internet-related concepts in layman’s terms.

You should now be familiar with all the major components of networks and how they all fit together. Take a minute to think back on everything you’ve learned. If you need a reminder, these were some of the topics:

- IP addresses
- DNS
- TCP/IP
- TLS
- HTTP

Remember what each does? Here’s your chance to prove it.

Create a google slidedeck and use it to screen-record a 4 to 5-minute long speech to give to a class of 3rd graders explaining how the Internet works. You should cover each of the topics above, but avoid technical jargon - remember, you’re teaching elementary school kids! The emphasis is on what each individual component does in practicality and how they all fit together, not teaching terminology and definitions.

Don’t be afraid to get creative with your explanations and come up with new analogies and demonstration ideas you haven’t yet seen. It’s your chance to be the teacher!
